Manually executing a task
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned above, it is possible to manually execute one or more
registered tasks from the BE module. When the selected tasks have
finished running, feedback is given about success or failure of each
task's run. There's one important thing to note: if the task was
overdue, a new execution date will be calculated. If the task was
**not** overdue, the previously calculated next execution date stays.

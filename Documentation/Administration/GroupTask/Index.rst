Grouping tasks together
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In case of a high number of different tasks, it may be useful to visually group similar tasks together:

   Grouping related tasks together

Scheduler task groups are records stored on the root page (pid=0). They may be created, edited and sorted with Web > List:

   Management of scheduler task groups

Individual tasks may then be edited as usual and associated to a given scheduler task group.

.. note::
   Tasks inside a hidden group are neither automatically executed nor displayed in the scheduler module.
